AUTO-WT TOOL
This system tests for different types of SQL injection vulnerabilities: union-based, time-based, error-based, boolean-based, content-based blind, and out-of-band. 
It uses the Streamlit library for the user interface and the Requests library to make HTTP requests.

REQUIREMENTS:

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
Python 3.x
Streamlit library (pip install streamlit)
Requests library (pip install requests)


USAGE:
1.Copy the code into a Python file, e.g., sql_injection_scanner.py.
2.Install the required dependencies.
3.Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is located.
4.Run the code using the command streamlit run sql_injection_scanner.py.
5.A browser window should open with the Streamlit app running.


Please NOTE:This is a basic SQL injection vulnerability scanner and may not detect all possible vulnerabilities. 
Remember to use this code responsibly and only on systems that you have proper authorization to test.
